# Memvid - Video-Based AI Memory (TypeScript/Node.js Version) ðŸ§ ðŸ“¹

**A lightweight, node-powered solution for AI memory at scale, now primarily in TypeScript.**

## About

This is an experimental TypeScript/Node.js rewrite of the original Python Memvid project, created primarily for experimental purposes using Google Jules. This version explores the feasibility of implementing video-based AI memory systems in the Node.js ecosystem, but should be considered experimental and may not have feature parity with the original Python implementation.
